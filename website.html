    <h3> School </h3>
    <h4> I am a rising senior at Bayside High School, who is in the Engineering CTE program. During my sophomore year, I applied to be in the Leadership class (which was probably my best decision made in high school). Through the class, I gained confidence, helped create school-wide events, made many friendships, and learn new things everyday. I joined programs/clubs like BSAC (Borough Schools Advisory Council), Student Council, Smiles for Miles, Yearbook, and Key Club. In the fall of 2019, I will be interning at <a href="http://www.jmvarchitect.com/">JMV Architect.</a> </h4>

    <h3> Personal </h3>
    <h4> I enjoy watching Netflix and sleeping, both activities keep me at peace and engaged. During 8th grade, my friend forced me into kpop and I enjoyed learning about the culture. From there, I watched kdramas and learned how to read Korean (which is pretty easy). In addition I enjoy reading fantasy books sometimes. I have this summer tradtition where I read the <a href="http://www.jessicashirvington.com/the-books/">Embrace Series</a>. This is mostly because that was the book that got me interested in reading, and I forget details easily. I love rereading or rewatching things because of my really bad memories. I had a huge One Direction phase LMFAO! I don't have a favorite genre, I like all types of music, movies, drama, PMO SOME NEW ONES! :D </h4>
